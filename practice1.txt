- cooking steps
---
  1. *Marinate the chicken*. Cut the chicken into bite-size cubes then mix with cornstarch, water and sesame oil.
  2. *Toast the peanuts* (or cashew nuts) in a pan until lightly brown.
  3. *Mix the sauce* with the following ingredients: light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, black rice vinegar, Shaoxing rice wine, sugar, cornstarch & water.
  4. *Stir fry the dish* by adding the ingredients to the wok in the **following sequence:**
      1. Oil, dried chilli & Sichuan pepper.
      2. Marinated chicken. 
      3. Scallions, garlic & ginger.
      4. The sauce.
      5. Toasted nuts.
- **Tips**
    **1. Set your wok over high heat and fry dried chillies & Sichuan pepper in oil first. Keep a close eye to avoid burning. As soon as you sense the fragrance of the spices, add the marinated chicken. At this point, the chillies should still look red. They will darken later on and produce a hint of smokiness. If they look dark already at this stage, you are likely to burn them in the end.**
    **2. Fry the chicken pieces for about 30 seconds, then add scallions, garlic & ginger. Make sure you stir constantly to evenly heat the ingredients. When the chicken completely loses its pinkness, they should be cooked. Use the spatula to cut a piece to check if youâ€™re not certain.**
    **3. Pour in the sauce (Give it a good stir beforehand). It will thicken pretty quickly (in about 20 seconds). Turn off the heat immediately.**
    **4. The last thing is to add the toasted peanuts (or cashew nuts). Stir to evenly distribute then dish out to serve.**
